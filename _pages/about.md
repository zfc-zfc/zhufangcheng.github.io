I'm **Fangcheng Zhu 朱方程**, a third-year Ph.D. student from the [**MaRS Lab**](https://mars.hku.hk/), Department of Mechanical Engineering, **University of Hong Kong**.
My research interests include but are not limited to Robotics, LiDAR-based SLAM, Sensor Calibration and Fusion, and Aerial Swarm Systems, Quadrotor Autonomous Navigation. Now I am dedicated to developing stable and feasible algorithms that enable robots (UAVs, service robots, autonomous vehicles) to perceive the external environment comprehensively and precisely. I envision a future where robots can truly enter every household and enhance the quality of human life.


Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
