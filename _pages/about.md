I'm **Fangcheng Zhu 朱方程**, a third-year Ph.D. student from the [**MaRS Lab**](https://mars.hku.hk/), Department of Mechanical Engineering, **University of Hong Kong**.

My research interests include but are not limited to **Robotics, LiDAR-based SLAM, Sensor Calibration and Fusion, and Aerial Swarm Systems, Quadrotor Autonomous Navigation.** 

Now I am dedicated to developing stable and feasible algorithms that enable robots (UAVs, service robots, autonomous vehicles) to perceive the external environment comprehensively and precisely. I envision a future where robots can truly enter every household and enhance the quality of human life.

Here are some wonderful pictures of my work:
