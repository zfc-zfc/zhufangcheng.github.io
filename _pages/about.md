I'm **Fangcheng Zhu 朱方程**, a Ph.D. student (2021-2025 expected) from the [**MaRS Lab**](https://mars.hku.hk/), Department of Mechanical Engineering, [University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk/) and my supervisor is [Prof. Fu Zhang](https://www.mech.hku.hk/academic-staff/zhang-f).

My research interests include but are not limited to **Robotics, LiDAR-based SLAM, Sensor Calibration and Fusion, and Aerial Swarm Systems, Quadrotor Autonomous Navigation.** 

In 2021, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Automation from [Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Shenzhen](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/), and the title of my undergraduate thesis is "Simultaneously Localization and Mapping Method based on Solid-State LiDAR", supervised by [Prof. Jie Mei](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/meijie).

Now I am dedicated to developing stable and feasible algorithms that enable robots (UAVs, service robots, autonomous vehicles) to perceive the external environment comprehensively and precisely. I envision a future where robots can truly enter every household and enhance the quality of human life. 

Beyond academia, I actively contribute to open-source projects. My research code on GitHub has accumulated over **5k stars** ⭐. Notable repositories include [**LiDAR_IMU_Init (★868)**](https://github.com/hku-mars/LiDAR_IMU_Init), [**Swarm-LIO2 (★231)**](https://github.com/hku-mars/Swarm-LIO2), [**FAST-LIO (★2.8k)**](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO), and [**FAST-LIVO2 (★1.2k)**](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST-LIVO2).
