I'm **Fangcheng Zhu 朱方程**, a Ph.D. student (2021-2025 expected) from the [**MaRS Lab**](https://mars.hku.hk/), Department of Mechanical Engineering, [University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk/) and my supervisor is [Prof. Fu Zhang](https://www.mech.hku.hk/academic-staff/zhang-f).

My research interests include but are not limited to **Robotics, LiDAR-based SLAM, Sensor Calibration and Fusion, and Aerial Swarm Systems, Quadrotor Autonomous Navigation.** 

In 2021, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Automation from [Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Shenzhen](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/), and the title of my undergraduate thesis is "Simultaneously Localization and Mapping Method based on Solid-State LiDAR", supervised by [Prof. Jie Mei](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/meijie).

 In 2019, I participated in an exchange program and studied at the [University of California, Berkeley (UCB)](https://www.berkeley.edu/) for a few months.

Now I am dedicated to developing stable and feasible algorithms that enable robots (UAVs, service robots, autonomous vehicles) to perceive the external environment comprehensively and precisely. I envision a future where robots can truly enter every household and enhance the quality of human life.
